a.
Many tasks can benefit from automation using cron or at. For example, log rotation
can be automated to archive or delete old logs regularly, helping manage disk space
more efficiently. Another useful automation is scheduling database backups during 
non-peak hours to protect data without disrupting users.

b.
Poorly managed automated tasks come with risks, like data loss if backups are not
correctly scheduled or tested, and system overload if too many resource-heavy tasks
run simultaneously. To prevent these issues, it's important to regularly test your
backup processes and stagger automated tasks to balance system resource usage effectively.
